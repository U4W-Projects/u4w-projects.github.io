        <h2 class="section-title">OUR COSMIC MISSION</h2>
        <p class="mission-text">
            To explore <strong>uncharted territories of innovation</strong>, forge interstellar-level technologies, and empower the next creative generation to reach further than any have before. We believe that humanity's destiny lies among the stars, and technology is our spacecraft.
        </p>
        <p class="mission-text">
            We believe the future is built by those who dare to dream big and act boldly. Every line of quantum code, every circuit, every algorithm is a <em>step forward</em> for humanity into the cosmos.
        </p>
        <p class="mission-text">
            At U4W, we don't just adapt to the future — we <strong>architect it</strong>. From quantum computing to interstellar communication systems, we're building the tools that will define humanity's next great leap into the cosmic frontier.
